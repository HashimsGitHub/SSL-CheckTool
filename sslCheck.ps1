.SYNOPSIS
    Enterprise HTTPS diagnostic tool - DNS, TCP, TLS, certificate security,
    real-world trust validation, HTTP response inspection, and ICMP ping in
    a single staged run. A comprehensive replacement for Invoke-WebRequest
    and Test-NetConnection on port 443.

.DESCRIPTION
    sslCheck.ps1 is a layered HTTPS connectivity and security inspection tool
    built for enterprise environments - both private and public endpoints,
    TLS-intercepted networks (e.g. Zscaler), and internal PKI scenarios.

    Each stage gates the next. If DNS fails, TCP is not attempted. If TCP
    fails, TLS is not attempted. All failures and warnings are caught
    gracefully and surfaced without crashing the script.

    Stages
    ------
    [Stage 1] DNS Resolution
        Resolves the hostname using an async lookup with a 3-second timeout.
        Displays all resolved IPs. Handles split-horizon DNS and private zones.
        Raw IP addresses bypass this stage.

    [Stage 2] TCP Reachability
        Explicit TCP connect with configurable timeout and retry support.
        On failure, automatically runs a fast Traceroute (capped hops, no
        reverse DNS lookups) to identify where in the network path traffic
        is being dropped. Suppressed with -SkipTraceroute.

    [Stage 3a] TLS Handshake & Certificate Inspection
        Connects with certificate bypass to inspect the cert regardless of
        whether it is trusted on the current machine. Reports:
          - Negotiated TLS version and cipher (flags weak ciphers in red)
          - SNI sent and HTTP version negotiated
          - Certificate subject, issuer, thumbprint, serial number
          - Signature algorithm (flags MD5 and SHA-1 as insecure)
          - Public key type and size (flags RSA under 2048-bit)
          - Expiry with days remaining and colour-coded urgency
          - Certificate type: Self-Signed / Publicly Trusted CA / Private CA
          - Full certificate chain from leaf to root with per-element expiry
          - Certificate Transparency SCT check for publicly trusted certs
          - SANs grouped by root domain with entry counts

    [Stage 3b] Real-World Trust Validation
        Makes a second TLS connection WITHOUT certificate bypass, using the
        Windows certificate store exactly as Invoke-WebRequest, browsers, and
        applications do. A failure here is why Invoke-WebRequest fails while
        Stage 3a passes. Reports the exact failure reason and remediation step.

    [Stage 3c] HTTP Response
        Sends a real HTTP GET via Invoke-WebRequest with redirect following
        disabled (-MaximumRedirection 0) to prevent browser popups on SSO/SAML
        protected endpoints. Reports status code, response time, all headers,
        images, input fields, links, raw content preview, and body size.
        Detects and labels SAML/OAuth redirect responses. Only runs if Stage
        3b passes.

    [Stage 4 - Optional] Legacy TLS Audit (-AuditLegacyTls)
        Non-destructive isolated probes for SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, 1.1,
        1.2, and 1.3. Does not affect the primary connection or result.
        SSL 2.0 and 3.0 flagged as critical (POODLE/DROWN).
        TLS 1.0 and 1.1 flagged as deprecated.

    [Connection Summary]
        Shown when all stages pass with no failures. Reports source IP and
        hostname (resolved via reverse DNS) and destination IP and hostname.

    [ICMP Ping]
        Sends 4 ICMP echo requests and displays full ping output matching
        native ping.exe format - reply lines, packet statistics, and round
        trip times. Handles IPv6 gracefully. Fails silently if ICMP is blocked
        by firewall or host policy with a clear informational note.

    [Warnings]
        All advisory items collected silently during every stage and printed
        together at the end. Suppressed entirely if a hard failure occurred -
        failures are shown inline at the stage where they happen.

    Read-only. No HTTP content is stored. No changes are made to the system.

.PARAMETER Uri
    The HTTPS endpoint to test. The https:// prefix is optional.
    Accepts FQDN, hostname, or raw IP address. Port can be embedded
    in the URI (e.g. https://example.com:8443) or passed via -Port.

.PARAMETER Port
    TCP port to connect to. Default: 443.
    Overridden by a port embedded in the URI.

.PARAMETER TimeoutMs
    Connection timeout in milliseconds for TCP and TLS operations.
    Default: 5000 (5 seconds). Increase for slow private endpoints.

.PARAMETER TraceRouteHops
    Maximum number of hops for the automatic Traceroute on TCP failure.
    Default: 15. Lower values complete faster; raise for long network paths.

.PARAMETER AuditLegacyTls
    Enables Stage 4 TLS version audit. Probes SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, and TLS
    1.0 through 1.3 using isolated non-destructive connections.

.PARAMETER SkipTraceroute
    Suppresses the automatic Traceroute when TCP connection fails.
    Use in environments where ICMP is blocked or the wait is unacceptable.

.PARAMETER RetryCount
    Number of additional TCP connection attempts after the first failure.
    Default: 0 (no retries). Use for flaky or rate-limited endpoints.

.PARAMETER RetryDelayMs
    Milliseconds to wait between TCP retry attempts. Default: 1000.

.PARAMETER ExportCerts
    Export all certificates in the chain to disk as .cer (DER), .pem (Base64),
    a full chain .pem, and a PKCS#7 .p7b bundle.
    Files are saved to a folder named after the hostname and timestamp.

.PARAMETER SaveReport
    Save the full run output as a colour-coded HTML report.
    Opens in any browser and can be printed to PDF via Ctrl+P.
    No external modules or installs required.

.PARAMETER ReportPath
    Directory to save the HTML report file.
    Default: Documents\sslCheck-Output under the current user profile.
    The directory is created if it does not exist.

.PARAMETER ExportPath
    Directory to save exported certificate files.
    Default: Documents\sslCheck-Output under the current user profile.
    A timestamped subfolder is created per run. The directory is created if it does not exist.
    Override with a full path e.g. -ExportPath "C:\Certs" (requires Administrator on Windows).

.EXAMPLE
    Basic check:
    .\sslCheck.ps1 -Uri https://example.com

.EXAMPLE
    Internal private endpoint with longer timeout:
    .\sslCheck.ps1 -Uri https://internal-api.corp.local -TimeoutMs 10000

.EXAMPLE
    HTTPS on non-standard port:
    .\sslCheck.ps1 -Uri https://example.com -Port 8443
    .\sslCheck.ps1 -Uri https://example.com:8443

.EXAMPLE
    Full audit including legacy TLS probe:
    .\sslCheck.ps1 -Uri https://example.com -AuditLegacyTls

.EXAMPLE
    Flaky endpoint with retries:
    .\sslCheck.ps1 -Uri https://flaky.example.com -RetryCount 2 -RetryDelayMs 2000

.EXAMPLE
    Skip traceroute on environments where ICMP is blocked:
    .\sslCheck.ps1 -Uri https://example.com -SkipTraceroute

.NOTES
    Author      : Hashim Hilal
    Script Name : sslCheck.ps1
    Version     : 3.2

    Intended use
    - Replaces Invoke-WebRequest for HTTPS endpoint health checks
    - Replaces Test-NetConnection -Port 443 with full TLS and cert detail
    - Enterprise PKI and private CA environments fully supported
    - Works behind TLS inspection proxies (Zscaler etc.) - results reflect
      the client-to-proxy leg, which is the correct trust boundary to test

    Certificate Export (-ExportCerts)
    Exports all chain certificates to a timestamped folder as .cer (DER),
    .pem (Base64), chain_full.pem (concatenated), and chain_full.p7b (PKCS#7).
    Private keys are never available from a TLS handshake and are not exported.
    Use -ExportPath to specify the output directory.

    Requirements
    - Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+
    - Windows 8 / Server 2012 or later
    - TLS 1.3 probing requires Windows 10 1903+ or Windows Server 2022
    - Traceroute requires Test-NetConnection (PS 4.0+ / Windows 8+)
    - No external modules required
